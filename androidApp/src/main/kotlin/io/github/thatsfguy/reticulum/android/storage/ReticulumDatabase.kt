         *   1. v1.1.33's MIGRATION_10_11 created columns + indices, but
         *      its @Entity didn't declare the indices, so Room's
         *      strict validator threw post-migration → users wiped
         *      data → fresh-install on v1.1.33 → Room created table
         *      from @Entity (no indices declared) → DB stored at v11
         *      with NO indices.
         *   2. v1.1.34 added the indices to @Entity. Fresh-install
         *      worked. But upgrade from v1.1.33-fresh tripped Room's
         *      identity-hash check on open: the schema hash baked
         *      into room_master_table by v1.1.33 didn't match the
         *      hash v1.1.34 derived from the (now-with-indices)
         *      @Entity. Crash before any migration could run.
         *   3. Bumping the version to v12 means Room expects a
         *      migration path from v11. This migration creates the
         *      indices `IF NOT EXISTS` — no-op for users who came
         *      via MIGRATION_10_11 (indices already on disk), works
         *      for v1.1.33-fresh users (missing indices, get them
         *      now). After migration, Room writes the v12 identity
         *      hash to room_master_table; subsequent opens match.
         *
         * The only path NOT covered: v1.1.33 installs that NEVER
         * launched successfully because their v10→v11 migration
         * crashed. Those rolled back; on v1.1.35 they enter the
